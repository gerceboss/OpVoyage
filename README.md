# OpVoyage

OpVoyage is a blockchain explorer and analytics platform for opBNB . It is in theory compatible with any rollups or L2s. For now we show the transactions happening in real-time on opBNB . In future we will include tags for smart contract based vulnerabilities like re-entrancy, arithmetic overflow/underflow, centralization risks etc . this will ensure and help in monitor users the transactions and withdraw their funds from such contracts as soon as possible.
This , in turn attracts more users to the opBNB blockchain as it provides security monitoring tools and that also ensures safety of their funds and builds trust.
